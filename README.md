# BODMAS-PEMDAS-Expression-Solver-Flowers-Apple-Ice-Leaf---F.A.I.L-
Just a basic program that should solve most valid expressions with
only the * / + - operators and parentheses. I added a ** ( power )
as a bonus! With the way I made the program, I could probably add 
more functions if I wanted to, although I would have to make more 
adjustments to make functions ): If you have advice then please let
me know. (Only if you want to give advice/critique) (Advice/critique 
about programming) I believe the solving method I used is called 
Reverse Polish Notation. It might not be the exact implementation.
But I think it should solve like it? I don't exactly know how it's
exactly implemented. I learned about how it worked around a year ago. 
(Roughly) and I programmed it based on what I remember. Programming 
in c has certainly opened my eyes. I have programmed in python for 
around 4 years and just. Wow, this type of programming is interesting. I know nothing. I guess I didn't improve as much I wanted to.
